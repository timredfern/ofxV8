Tim Redferns fork of ofxV8
=============================================================================================================

I had to change the order of the includes and remove a redundant declaration to make this compile with gcc4.6

See http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php/topic,10840.0.html

I updated to the latest (October 2012) version of v8 and linked to the shared library (-lv8)

To compile this in linux, first install v8 from https://developers.google.com/v8/build
